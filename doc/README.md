ascii_art
=========

This is JavaScript based ASCII art generator.  It should work in any modern browser.

It's written to work with my custom build content management system, so you'll have to make some minor changes:
- Copy and paste the HTML code from `make.php`
- Link the JavaScript (`ascii.js`) and CSS (`style.css`)
- Call the function `start()`.  (Using my CMS, this is attached to the `body.onload` event.)
